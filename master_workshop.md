# Workshops

Some groups of students have contributed to the community by running the following workshops.


## bookdown

Weixi Yao and Wangzhi Li

This introductory workshop on bookdown is designed to give a complete guide to the bookdown package. The workshop is split into two parts. The first part covers the basic information, including what is bookdown, why use bookdown and what are the other options avaiable. The second part serves as a practice session, and each attendee will try to build their own books using the instruction we provide. 

If the attendees want to know more about bookdown, they can always go back to our slides for reference. We have uplodaed our complete slide to the repo (url: https://github.com/yweixi/EDAV-community-contribution.git; file name: EDAV Community Contribution.pdf).

Also, all the materials we use during the workshop can be found in a seperate repo (url: https://github.com/SafeguardLi/SafeguardLi.github.io.git).


## R Package Writing

Siddhant Shandilya and Mohit Chander Gulla

R packages are an ideal way to package and distribute R code and data for re-use by others.

This workshop will provide you with an overview of how to create your own pacakge in R. 

The walkthrough gives step by step instructions on how to define your functions, create a project for your package, embed your functions and its documentation within it and finally how to compile and build it into an R package that is ready to be shared or published.

All the materials used in the workshop can be found at: https://github.com/siddhantshandilya/EDAV---Community-Contribution-19

You may refer to the reference links provided at the end of the pdf which goes into further details on how to publish your package on CRAN repository, if you are interested.



## RegEx Workshop Summary

Author: Cheng Yan, Chao Huang

This workshop may offer you a basic understanding of regular expression and how it can be used to solve various problems. The workshop is divided into four sections, from the definition of regular expression to the application of regular expression in EDAV. This page is just a roadmap of the workshop and you can find more details and examples in the slides of the workshop [here](resources/regex_workshop/RegEx_101.pdf).

**Definition of Regular Expression**

In this section, we introduce the definition of regular expression and typical scenarios where we can apply this powerful tool.

**Basic syntax of Regular Expression**

In this section, we introduce the basic syntax of regular expression, including wildcards, set, meta-characters, repeated matches, position matching and etc. These patterns can help solve most of the string manipulation problems we meet in our daily work.

**Advanced syntax of Regular Expression**

Besides basic syntax, we also introduce some more advanced techniques, including group capturing and looking around. With these tools, you can construct more complex and also more powerful regular expressions. 

**Application in EDAV**

By using regular expression to solve a string wrapping problem given at PSet2 in one line of code, we show how to compile and use regular expression in R.

For those who want to know more about regular expression, two books are highly recommended, namely __*"Sams Teach Yourself Regular Expressions in 10 Minutes"*__ and __*"Mastering Regular Expressions"*__.


## Data_Visualization_Workshop

Yuheng Shi & Banruo Xie

We will introduce two very interesting data visualization graphic. The first goal of this workshop is to expand our foundamential data visualization knowledge and try to build more sophisticated graphics that contain more important data information. The second goal would be how we could use different factors to build multiple dimensions in one graphics and help readers interpret data better and draw more meaningful conclusions.

If the attendees want to know more about bookdown, they can always go back to our slides for reference. We have uplodaed our complete slide to the repo (url: https://github.com/HansShi/EDAV_Community_Contribution; file name: data visualization workshop.pdf).


## Tweepy

Kevin Womack

On Friday, October 25, 2019, I co-hosted a two-part workshop for undergraduates from Morehouse College, Spelman College, and Clark Atlanta University on data mining social media platforms for applications in threat detection. For the sake of time and simplicity, I elected to solely concentrate on Twitter for the source of data in my tutorial and utilize Python to simplify the implementation process and limit code-writing confusion. \


[Part One](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mGZE6xk5paXZISmHPAvkKYFein-a-xzQ7wVQp3bsvaU/edit?usp=sharing) (<- clickable link to slides) of the workshop was a Python review to catch everyone up to speed on the syntax they would need to perform basic tasks in the language.

[Part Two](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1STll7172DMys6xQaZvF4BJYNP8rBtBZIXb4c7NS6Cp8/edit?usp=sharing) (<- clickable link to slides) of the workshop was an overview of the Tweepy documentation with intermittent live demos. \


A review of my experience hosting this workshop was submitted on Courseworks with this file.


## NLP Basics With Python

Ashutosh Kanitkar

For my coummunity contribution, I decided to teach a lecture on NLP(Natural Language Processing) for Master of Social Work (MSW) students.There were quite a few challenges that i faced, when i was deciding the content of my lecture.Some of which were how mathemathically deep should i go and teach them about NLP, how much deep should i teach them about coding, which language and library should i demonstrate my NLP code in, etc. After much deliberation i came to conclusion that these students do not need to learn the mathemathics of NLP rather they need to learn basic concepts of NLP and how to apply NLP for some tasks that they might encounter. I distinctly remember that at end of my lecture, there were quite a few people who wanted to see output of what it looks like when a syntax is run( which was shown to them).Additionally as a bonus i showed them how to visualize basic concepts taught during lecture using displacy.This experience was extremely satisfying for me and i enjoyed it thoroughly. 
Notes that i used during the lecture are available at below url

## GitHub Help Session 

Karthik Rajaraman Iyer and Akshay Pakhle

We held a walk in doubt session for peers , helping them resolve issues with the github workflow. While some had trouble setting up environment variables in GitBash, other common clarifications were about the brached workflow, creation/handing of pull requests and the appropriate use of issues.

We also helped in designing a practice assignment to get a grasp over the github workflow.


## Volunteering through TEALS 

(Technology and Education Literacy in Schools)

Amanda Steigman



This school year, I am a volunteer teaching assistant at a high school for a class of 23 11th graders taking their first computer science class. I got involved in this through a program called  [TEALS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/teals)(Technology Education and Literacy in Schools) and attend one of the two classes they have each week to help students work through labs and answer any questions they might have. For my community contribution, I created [data visualizations](https://github.com/asteigman/TEALS-viz/blob/master/TEALS_for_class.pdf) related to gender diversity in STEM inspired by this program.
